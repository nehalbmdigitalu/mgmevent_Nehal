                <p class="paragraph">Qawwali is of such significance to so many of us and has such a rich history in
                    this country. The opportunity to add to that tapestry and to present our interpretation of it at a
                    venue as culturally-fitting and as venerated as the Royal Albert Hall is nothing short of a dream
                    come true.</p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    As an ode to the rich qawwali heritage and the highly passionate qawwals, a new photo project has
                    documented their performances, that is now showcased as The Qawwali Project: An Untold Story. The
                    exhibition, which features clicks by ace photographers Dinesh Khanna, Mustafa Quraishi and Leena
                    Kejriwal, is on view till November 28, 2021 at the India International Centre. Curated by Kathak
                    dancer Manjari Chaturvedi, the show is in collaboartion with Sufi Kathak Foundation and Nazar
                    Foundation; Qawwal Ustad Ranjhan Ali Dargah at Hazrat Bannnay Shah, Qadiri Silsila, Amritsar,
                    Punjab, India.

                <p>Qawwali is a captivating and spiritual musical tradition that originated in the mystic Sufi circles
                    of South Asia. Rooted in the devotional poetry of Sufi saints, Qawwali serves as a profound means of
                    expressing love and devotion to the divine. The heart of Qawwali lies in its soul-stirring melodies,
                    rhythmic handclaps, and the powerful vocals of the qawwals (singers). </p>
